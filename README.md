# Connect4

This project was built upon a third party library, Grid World Case Study.

Connect 4 is a board game that is played generally by 2 players, with each of them taking turns to place a piece. The goal is to connect 4 piece of your own color to win.
I customised the Connect 4 so that the board size can changed through editing the main Connect4 class as well as changing how many pieces are required to win the game.
